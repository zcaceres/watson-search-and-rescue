INSTALLATION
-------------

I. IMPORT SUIMONO BASE FILES INTO YOUR PROJECT

Go to: "Assets -> Import Package -> Custom Package..." in the Unity Menu. Then select the
"Suimono_watersystem_v2.x.unitypackage" file.  This will open an import dialog box.
Click the import button and all the Suimono files will be imported into your project list.

A Note about Demo Content... The Suimono installer file contains a large number of files for the advanced demo scene.  If you don’t need this scene in your project, you can disable importing the demo content by unchecking the SUIMONO - WATER SYSTEM 2/_DEMO folder in the import dialog window before importing.


II. ADD THE SUIMONO PREFABS TO YOUR SCENE

1) Drag the SUIMONO_Module prefab (located in the "/PREFABS" folder) into your scene.
2) Drag the SUIMONO_Surface prefab (located in the "/PREFABS" folder) into your scene.
3) Add your main scene camera to the 'scene camera object' slot on the module.
4) (NEW!) Add your main scene directional light to the 'scene light object' slot on the module.
5) (NEW!) Go to your scene camera object and (if necessary) add the Underwater component by going to Component-->Image Effects-->Suimono-->UnderwaterFX


That's it for the basic installation!  You can now position “SUIMONO_Surface” anywhere in your scene that you like, and even rename the “Suimono_Surface” object to anything you wish. This object can also be scaled to fit your scene, but please see the scale note below!
More in depth installation and setup instructions, as well as a helpful FAQ can be found in the full documentation PDF, available here: http://tanukidigital.com/suimono/documentation

A NOTE ABOUT UPGRADES:
Since this is a major update it's recommended to delete your current Suimono scene objects, the suimono effect on your camera, and then completely delete the Suimono folder in the Project list, and delete any suimono specific game layers before installing this update.

CUSTOMIZATION NOTES
----------------------------
DEFINING YOUR SCENE CAMERA:
Suimono tracks a scene camera in order to determine when to initiate the underwater switch. By default Suimono will track the scene camera object that has it’s object tag set to “MainCamera”. However, you can customize which camera Suimono tracks (under the module configuration tab) by changing the 'Camera Mode' to 'Manual Select Camera' and then adding your camera to the 'Scene Camera Object'”' attribute before running your scene.  If you're game is designed around a 3rd person controller, you'll want to designate your character object as the "Scene Track Object"... otherwise for most first-person games, the scene track object would be the same as the scene camera object.  If the scene track object is left vacant it Suimono will automatically set it to the scene camera object specified above.

RELEASE NOTES - Version 2.1.3
-----------------------------
WHAT'S NEW:
- Suimono now logs and disables some Module functions when no surfaces are visible.
- Added Action Types to FX Objects.  Can now designate how many times an effect repeats: once, specific #, or forever).

CHANGES:
- Removed custom shader keywords, which drastically improves shader compilation speed and reduces memory footprint.
- Suimono no longer forces MSAA to be off, but it's still recommended to keep it off in order to use HDR lighting and eliminate possible render issues.
- Added 'Disable MSAA' option on Module settings.  Disabling MSAA in Forward helps fixes possible rendering errors.
- Default buoyancy range raised to 500.
- CameraTool component can now selectively change camera HDR mode (defaults to off).
- Improved render texture accuracy, helps improve foam and depth visuals over long distances.

BUG FIXES:
- Fixed erroneous 'materials' error message spam in Unity 5.4+ (yes, let rejoicing commence).
- Fixed unexpected symbol bug in SuimonoGaia.cs file.
- fixed underwater fog combining with transparent objects (for example, clouds, billboards, etc.)
- Layer initialization set to run only on start to help improve performance.
- Added Reference checking in some cases to avoid component memory loss errors.
- Cast Lists as non-serializable, to fix mangled string bug.
- Fixed possible preset loading/saving error, resulting from rigid float-decoding format assumptions (now use InvariantCulture instead).
- Fixed Module UI layout to reveal hidden 'interaction' option.
- Re-enabled global Interaction on/off function (enables buoyancy, fx objects, and underwater detection).
- Added local Interaction function for each water surface (enables buoyancy, fx objects, and underwater detection).
- Fixed an issue with reflection rendering not performing properly in HDR with some 3rd party assets.  reflection color should be brightened to compensate.
- Caustic rendering now properly adjusts when tracked light is disabled.
- Water surface specular no longer disappears when Trnasparency function is turned off.
- Fixed bug with Shoreline generation function failing in Unity 5.5+
- Buyoancy object 'Keep At Surface' setting now works properly again.
- Fixed issue with UI scaling out of window on OSX.
- Fixed double rendering of custom prefab icons.
